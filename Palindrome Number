Problem - 

Given an integer x, return true if x is palindrome integer.
An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward. For example, 121 is palindrome while 123 is not.

Example 1:
Input: x = 121
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

Example 3:
Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

Example 4:
Input: x = -101
Output: false

Constraints:
-231 <= x <= 231 - 1

            reverse = reverse * 10 + remainder;
            x = x / 10;
        }
        if(number == reverse){
            return true;
        }
        else
        {
            return false;
        }
    }
