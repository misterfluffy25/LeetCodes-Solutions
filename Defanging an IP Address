PROBLEM - 

Given a valid (IPv4) IP address, return a defanged version of that IP address.

A defanged IP address replaces every period "." with "[.]".

 

Example 1:

Input: address = "1.1.1.1"
Output: "1[.]1[.]1[.]1"
Example 2:

Input: address = "255.100.50.0"
Output: "255[.]100[.]50[.]0"
 

Constraints:

The given address is a valid IPv4 address.
